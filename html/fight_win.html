            <p class="project_summary">Fight &amp; Win is a <strong>1 vs 1 fighting and gambling game</strong>, and was developed as a <strong>Game Jam project</strong> in 2016. The client-side is completely developed using <strong>HTML5 and Javascript (Canvas API)</strong>, and the server-side uses <strong>NodeJS and SocketIO</strong>.</p>

                <p>The Game Jam rules were to develop a video game that incuded gambling in some way. Fight &amp; Win includes an initial bet before the fight starts, and that money is directly related to the Health Points of your character, meaning that each time you lose health, you also lose money. At the end of the fight, each player receives an ammount of money that is dependant on how much Health Points did the enemy lose during the fight.</p>

				<p>Instead of using a Javascript framework for making games, I developed the whole game by hand (using Javascript and HTML5 Canvas API) in order to <strong>learn how to manage sprites, simple 2D physics and overall game logic</strong>. Also, <strong>I learned the basics of multiplayer games</strong> thanks to the implementation of the server-side of the game.
