            <p class="project_summary">A third person shooter game where your objective is to escape from a small city under 4 minutes, using only your shotgun (and your infinite ammo). This project was <strong>developed within 2 weeks</strong>, during the <strong>Unity3D subject</strong> in the Master's Degree in Game Programming.</p>

				<p>As we only had 2 weeks of development and no artists nor designers, we had to cover every possible role. We used the simple idea of a countdown for making a replayable, 1-level game. For the 3D assets, we had to use the Unity Store and find something with human models, animations and scene props. During the development of this game, <strong>we learned several Unity3D concepts such as simple AI behaviors, camera management and game logic basics</strong>.</p>
